# JobSearch
## Basis of Project
This project takes in a file that has a list of jobs and loads it into a Linked List data structure. Once it has been loaded, the jobs are "processed" depedning on their given time, which is compared to the system time. It emulates a database server where jobs are deleted on they are processed.
